Odin Project Recipe Website

Hi! My name is Becky and I am an app developer at a startup in California. I am currently working in a cloudbased, 
proprietary IDE. The Odin Project is giving me the opportunity to brush up on my basic web development skills. As a bonus, 
I'm practicing my git skills! This project is just for fun right now, but who knows!
